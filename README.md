# Role of Data in AI?
Data is the fuel for Artificial Intelligence.
Without data, AI cannot learn, predict, or make decisions.

# Why Data Is Critical:
Trains AI models
Helps AI recognize patterns
Improves accuracy and reliability
Enables continuous learning and optimization
📌 Better data = Better AI performance.

# Types of Data Used in AI
# 1️⃣ Structured Data
Highly organized data stored in fixed formats.

# Examples:
Tables
Databases
Excel sheets
CSV files
# Characteristics:
Easy to search and analyze
Stored in rows and columns
Used in business analytics, CRM systems, banking

# 2️⃣ Unstructured Data
Data without a predefined structure.
# Examples:
Text (emails, documents, chats)
Audio (calls, voice recordings)
Images (photos, scans)
Video (CCTV, interviews)
# Characteristics:
Makes up ~80% of real-world data
Harder to process
Requires AI techniques like NLP and Computer Vision
